## SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND


### WELCOME


## OVERVIEW OF ACL

Founded by Dr. James House, the Americans’ Changing Lives (ACL) [https://acl.isr.umich.edu/] study
began in 1986, with a national face-to-face survey of 3,617 adults. Since then ACL has followed the
same group of people in neighborhoods across the country for more than 33 years (1986, 1989, 1994,
2001/2002, 2011/2012 and 2019).
Up to this point, the ACL study has shown how our social connections and neighborhoods can affect
our lives and ability to get by day-to-day. Research suggests that our neighborhoods have an important
impact on our health. The quality of the resources in our neighborhoods and surrounding area can
impact how well we can accomplish our everyday tasks, how physically active we are, what we eat, and
how connected we are to family and friends. All of these parts of our everyday lives can impact our
overall health as we age, including our risk for such diseases as cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
The most recent ACL- study ACL6 Wave 6 led by Dr. Maggie Hicken included two data collection
components: a 70 minute telephone interview that was similar in content to ACL1 Wave1 through ACL5
Wave 5; and a new Home Visit component for physical measures and blood collection. Using the
collected specimen samples for DNA methylation analysis via epigenetics, Dr. Hicken and the other ACL6
researchers seek to better understand how our health is affected by our neighborhoods, work, and
social lives as we age.
ACL-LIFE STUDY
Picking up where Dr. House, and more recently, Dr. Hicken and others left off, the ACL-Life study is led
by Dr. Sarah Burgard. Dr. Burgard is the current Director of the Population Studies Center (PSC) at the
U-M Institute for Social Research (ISR) and conducts research on the social stratification of aging and
health with population-based survey data. She has published extensively on the social factors
underlying health disparities by socioeconomic status, gender, and race/ethnicity across life courses.
Her ACL-Life study will build on the six previous waves of data from the nationally-representative
study, to understand how older adults recall major moments in their life, and how useful these
recollections are for understanding how people stay healthy as they age.
For this data collection effort, living ACL panel members (n=1,283) will be contacted by Survey Services

Lab (SSL) interviewers and Field interviewers starting February 2021 through August. Data collection
includes a 70-min, full retrospective life history (from age 0 to now), telephone interview. The survey
covers a range of domains from childhood circumstances to work, marital and parental histories, to life
events and health history.

## SHARELIFE

ACL-Life is a replication of the SHARE life history interview (SHARELIFE). SHARE is the Survey of Health
Aging and Retirement in Europe, which is a conglomeration of “sister studies” modeled on the
University of Michigan Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Although the SHARELIFE interview was
conducted in person, and computer assisted, the ACL-Life interview will be conducted by telephone. To
mimic the SHARELIFE interview as much as possible, the life history calendar “grid” will be displayed for
the interviewer in Blaise (to be discussed later)

## METHODOLOGY


### Event History Calendar

Event History Calendar (EHC) methods are used to address recall problems in retrospective life history
(RLH) data. To reduce recall error and recall bias, investigators have adopted the EHC methods to assist
respondents reporting retrospectively on their lives.
Rather than following the strict ordering of a standard survey instrument, EHCs use a flexible
interviewing approach to collect calendar time course information for different domains of life, such as
residential, parenting, and employment histories. The methodology is designed to improve cuing of
autobiographical memory and reduce a range of threats to recall accuracy. However, while they have
been tested against standard survey questionnaire formats, Retrospective Life History (RLH) data
collected with Event History Calendar (EHC) methods for studies like SHARELIFE have only infrequently
been compared against prospectively-collected data covering the same periods and experiences. For
the ACL study, researchers will be able to use the retrospective data collected on ACL-Life and the
prospective data collected during waves ACL- Wave1 through ACL6-Wave6 to compare responses for the
same events and/or conditions, and to see if or how much reporting bias matters.

### Prenotification Mailing

The pre-notification mailing for ACL-Life included a Life History Grid (LHG). An example of the LHG is
found in the Study Guide Appendix. The LHG is a tool for participants to make notes about important





**Keywords:** Retrospective Life History, Event History Calendar, SHARELIFE, ACL-Life, Survey Methodology,  Health and Retirement Study (HRS),  Recall Bias, Telephone Interview
<!-- Page 3 -->


events that occurred during different 10-year periods of their life. During the phone interview,
participants can use the LHG as a visual reference, and they can also add information if the interview
questions help participants remember additional life events. After the interview is completed,
participants are asked to return the LHG (along with a Verification Form) in a Business Reply Mail
envelope that was also included in the pre-notification mailing.
The ACL-Life Blaise instrument includes a life-history grid for entering a participant’s responses about
life events. See the Life-History Grid manual in Canvas for more information.

### FUNDING

The National Institute of Aging (NIA) is supporting the ACL-Life study. The 6th wave of the ACL study
conducted in 2019 was funded by the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities
(NIMHD). Previous waves of data collection were funded by the National Institute of Aging (NIA). In
the mid- 1990s, during a brief hiatus in NIA support, data analysis activities were also supported
by a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Investigators in Health Policy Award to James S. House.

## SECTION 2: SAMPLE


## WHO IS PART OF THE AMERICANS’ CHANGING LIVES PANEL STUDY?

1986 Beginnings ACL1-Wave1
The study began in 1986 with a national face-to-face survey of 3617 adults ages 25 and up in the
continental United States. African Americans and people aged 60 and over were over-sampled at twice

the rate of others. Sample size 3,617, Response Rate-68% - 70%, ● 86-minute face-to-face interview
1989 ACL2-Wave2
In 1989 face-to-face re-interviews were conducted with 83% (n=2867) of those still
alive. Survivors have been re-interviewed by phone, and where necessary face-to-face, in 1994, In
person was an 89-minute face-to-face re-interview. Method note-
Continuous mortality tracking through the National Death Index (NDI) and others
1994 ACL3-Wave3
45-minute telephone or face-to-face re-interview of 2,562 (or 83% of survivors, including
164 proxy interviews)
2001 ACL4-Wave4:
45-minute telephone or face-to-face re-interview of 1,787 (or 76%-80% of survivors,
including 95 proxy interviews)
2011 ACL5-Wave5:
70-minute telephone or face-to-face re-interview of 1,424 survivors (or 81% of survivors,
including 108 proxy interviews)
2019 ACL6-Wave6:
60-minute telephone re-interview of 748 (or 56% of survivors, including 19 proxy interviews)
2021
You will be interviewing our respondents again in 2021.

## CHARACTERISTICS OF A PANEL STUDY

Panel studies are designed to measure change. The quality of the data is enhanced immensely by
collecting multiple observations over time. The best measure of change and the factors that influence
change come from interviewing the same individuals who were interviewed in previous waves.
Interviewing the same group of respondents allows us to consider the impact and inter-relationships of
health, relationships, and financial factors over time.

## MORE THAN ONE RESPONDENT IN A HOUSEHOLD

Another critical feature of panel studies is that, whenever possible, the same reporter should provide
the data across waves. The nature of a panel study requires the ability to denote change across time. If
the reporter of the information is different, then any observed change in the data cannot be definitively





**Keywords:** Longitudinal Study, Panel Study, ACL Study,  Re-interview, Mortality Tracking, National Death Index (NDI),  Data Quality,  Change Measurement
<!-- Page 5 -->


viewed as true change. The observed change may be related to a different reporter of the information.
ACL-Life does, however, provide certain situations where a participant may need assistance to
complete the interview.
Two Common situations for Respondent Assistance
The two most common situations when a respondent may need
assistance are:
1) a health or physical impairment, or
2) has a cognitive impairment and may need help answering some factual questions.
Rather than lose this valuable information, we allow an informant (often a family member) to help the
respondent with some types of questions during the phone interview. More details on the
circumstances when an assisted interview may be conducted are provided later in this study guide.

## REINTERVIEW SAMPLE

The Reinterview (ReIw) sample is defined as those respondents for whom we obtained an interview in
the previous ACL6-Wave6 in 2019. The interview obtained could have been a Self Interview or a Proxy
Interview. Reinterview respondents are primarily asked to answer new content questions for this wave.
Reinterviews make up about 56% of the sample.

## RECONTACT SAMPLE

The Recontact (ReCon) sample is defined as those respondents for whom we were unable to obtain an
interview during the last wave. The inability to obtain an interview for these people might have been
due to the respondent refusing to participate and/or granting permission for a proxy interview. He or
she may have been too ill and a proxy reporter could not be identified, or we might have been unable to
locate him or her after a move. About 44% of the sample will be recontacts. At the end of the ACL-Life
interview, we will ask those who did not complete ACL6-Wave6 (neither themselves nor by a Proxy) if
they would like to complete the ACL6-Wave6 interview.
Information about past wave participation may be found in the Respondent’s Profile in SurveyTrak.

## INSTITUTIONALIZED SAMPLE

We always follow our sample members and attempt to interview them, even if they have moved into an
institutional setting such as a nursing home. The majority of respondents who reside in some kind of
institutional setting will be there due to health and age problems.





**Keywords:** ACL-Life, Respondent Assistance, Reinterview Sample, Recontact Sample, Institutionalized Sample, SurveyTrak, Proxy Interview,  Cognitive Impairment
<!-- Page 6 -->


The rate of respondents residing in nursing homes has increased over the years as the study population
ages. Respondents residing in nursing homes are still eligible to complete an interview, although it may
be more likely that an assisted interview will be necessary.
If you have an incarcerated respondent, talk to your Team Leader before proceeding. He or she will
communicate with the Production Manager and Study Staff for additional instructions. In general, we do
not conduct interviews with incarcerated respondents.

## SECTION 3: TYPES OF INTERVIEWS AND RESPONDENTS

PREVIOUS ACL6 Wave6 CHARACTERISTICS (2019)
• Self and Proxy interviews completed at ACL6-Wave6 – 729 self – 19 proxies
• Re-interviews and Re-contacts completed at ACL6-Wave6 (Self interviews) 711 reinterviews
18 re-contacts who completed previous waves but not the last one
Re-interviews + Re-contacts for ACL-Life
• Re-interviews + Re-contacts for ACL-Life – Potentially 729 reinterviews (less those who have died in the
last year) + – ~ 573 re-contacts who completed previous waves but not the last one.

## SELF INTERVIEW

The Self Interview in the Main instrument is one in which the respondent answers the questions for
him/herself. Most of the interviews you will administer will be Self Interviews.

## ASSISTED SELF INTERVIEW

An Assisted Self Interview in the Main instrument is one in which a knowledgeable informant assists
the respondent in answering the survey questions. The assistant for the respondent may help
throughout the whole interview, assisting the respondent in answering any questions, or he or she may
assist during only part of the interview.
When to conduct a self assisted interview
You will conduct an Assisted Self Interview when the respondent is capable of answering some or most
of the questions in the interview but may not have complete or accurate knowledge about some of the
more complex subjects, such as the exact dates of every job change, for example.
Who answered the question options
At the end of all sections, the application will ask who answered the questions in this section and if the
respondent received assistance with the answers for that section. You will have the option to select





**Keywords:** Assisted interviews, Self-interviews,  Nursing home residents,  Incarcerated respondents,  Survey methodology,  Longitudinal study,  ACL6 Wave6
<!-- Page 7 -->


“Respondent only,” “Respondent and proxy,” or “Proxy only.” Choose the option that best fits your
interview situation. If a spouse, adult child, or other person was present during the interview but did not
help answer questions, you would mark “Respondent only” at the PROXY CHECK Screen.

### Proxy Only Validation Error

If "Proxy Only" has completed 3 sections, the Blaise instrument will return a validation error box:
"The proxy has now completed 3 sections alone. Please assess if the respondent is able to complete the
majority of the interview without the help of a proxy. If they are not able to, please suspend the
interview and refer the respondent to your team leader."
Please suspend the case as a"4902 Hold, Procedural Problem" and discuss with your TL. She may then
ask the study program office to review and determine next steps.

## ASSISTED SELF INTERVIEW GUIDELINES

However unlikely, some of the new respondents may suffer age-related impairments including physical
and/or mental changes, such as occasional difficulty recalling a name or number, reliance on calendars
or notes to oneself as a reminder of appointments, and trouble concentrating when there is a lot of
background noise (such as other conversations or the TV). Physical limitations, such as hearing loss,
having less physical endurance than in earlier years, and some disease conditions like arthritis (which
may make holding a phone for extended periods difficult), are also symptoms of normal aging. While
these experiences may be frustrating, they do not dramatically affect day-to-day functioning.

### Ethical Research Norms Considerations

Please keep in mind that ethical research norms require that individuals always be aware when data
are being collected about them from another individual. Sometimes impairment will not be
immediately obvious. When speaking to respondents you should be alert to clues suggesting
impairments, making it burdensome or impossible to complete an interview, and be ready to
introduce the options of an Assisted Self interview when appropriate.

## ASSESSING A RESPONDENTS PHYSICAL OR COGNATIVE ABILITY

Assessing a respondent’s physical or cognitive ability to complete an interview is not necessarily a simple
task, particularly since contact with households will be by phone. Through careful listening and attention
to behaviors that could be associated with impairment, you should be able to make a judgment about
the respondent’s ability to do the interview. You may also encounter situations where you obtain





**Keywords:** Proxy interviews, Blaise instrument, Assisted self-interview, Respondent validation, Ethical research norms, Data collection, Interviewer guidelines, Age-related impairments
<!-- Page 8 -->


information from an informant, which helps you make your assessment.
Clues from Respondents
Some sample members can carry on social conversations quite well, yet cannot perform a task which is
somewhat more structured, such as one requiring memory skills or the ability to think about complex
matters (like doing an interview). Thus, it is possible that you will not realize that a sample member is
cognitively impaired and incapable of providing accurate responses to the questions until you have
already started an interview.
It is difficult to provide a checklist of the signs of cognitive impairment. Interviewers tell us that these
situations come to light slowly and the signs can be subtle. Some behaviors that could indicate
impairment are:
• Respondent continually provides contradictory responses.
• Respondent refuses to answer many of the questions, particularly the ones requiring use of
memory. While respondents are always allowed to refuse questions and it is difficult to say how
many refused questions might signal a problem, you should try to be aware of this behavior.
• Respondent does not know the answers to questions, particularly routine questions such as year
of birth or how many children he or she has. Again, it is reasonable that we sometimes forget a
few things, so stay in tune with the respondent and his or her particular circumstances.
• Respondent becomes progressively agitated, upset, or confused as the interview progresses.
These behaviors may be a sign that the respondent is simply tired and can finish the interview
another day. Such behaviors could, however, indicate that the respondent is unable to perform
the task of answering the questions.
Degree of Impairment
Moderate to severe forms of physical and cognitive impairment need to be handled differently
depending on the degree and type of disability. You will not encounter impairment situations very often,
particularly among younger respondents. For those situations in which you do encounter impairment,
the explanations below will help you in your decision to use an assistant for the interview.

### Physical Impairment

Moderate physical disabilities include the very hard of hearing, paralysis due to stroke which affects the
speech, frailty associated with arthritis, osteoporosis or other physical illness, and recovery from illness





**Keywords:** Cognitive impairment, respondent assessment, interview techniques, data quality, survey methodology, contradictory responses, cognitive disability, informant information
<!-- Page 9 -->


or surgery. Sometimes these types of situations can be handled by rescheduling a phone appointment
for later in the study period. You may, however, wish to find an assistant who can help with the
interview.
Severe physical disabilities include deafness, inability to speak (muteness), severe and permanent
illness, and long-term hospitalization. In these situations, an assisted interview may not be
appropriate. If it appears a respondent will not be able to answer the survey questions, even with
the help of an assistant, the case should be referred to a team leader.

### Cognitive Impairment

Moderate degrees of cognitive impairment can be symptoms of the early stages of cognitive decline
found in Alzheimer’s disease or other forms of senility. This is sometimes evidenced by repetition of the
same story or asking the same question over and over. Frustration or anxiety over not being able to
answer questions, difficulty concentrating for extended periods of time (inability to focus on the
questions), or frequent digression or rambling may also be signs.
Severe cases of mental impairment, such as those associated with dementia or Alzheimer’s disease, are
relatively easy to identify. A sample member with severe mental impairment likely not be able to
complete an interview for ACL-Life. The behaviors and symptoms may be extreme degrees of the
symptoms listed above.
Assessing if an Assisted Interview is needed
If the degree of impairment is mild to moderate, you will need to assess whether an Assisted Self
Interview is appropriate. Remember that an Assisted Self Interview is one in which the respondent can
answer most of the questions and only needs some help with complicated facts, such as financial
information. The respondent may just need someone to help “jog” his or her memory a bit. If the
impairment does not become apparent until after the interview has begun, you will need to tactfully
inquire about someone to assist the respondent. If the respondent’s spouse or other knowledgeable
adult is present and available, you may continue the interview as an Assisted Self Interview. If no one is
available to assist the respondent immediately, you will need to suspend the interview until
arrangements can be made to identify someone to perform that role.

## CHOOSING AN ASSISTANT

Typically, in situations requiring an assistant, the respondent will be able to suggest someone who might





**Keywords:** Assisted interviews, cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, dementia, survey methodology, respondent assistance,  ACL-Life (assuming this is a study or survey name),  interview challenges
<!-- Page 10 -->


be able to help out. If the respondent is not sure who would be an appropriate assistant, try to identify a
family member, such as a spouse or other adult, who is willing to assist the sample member in
completing the interview. Keep in mind that the individual should be well informed of the respondent’s
circumstances and knowledgeable about different aspects of the respondent’s history, such as previous
jobs, education, health history, and finances.
In some cases, particularly when the impairment is severe, we may not be able to proceed with an
interview for ACL-Life since we will not be conducting Proxy-Only interviews. If the R has severe
cognitive impairments that prevent them from giving informed consent or remembering many details of
their life history, the interview should not proceed and the case should be referred to the team leader.

## DECEASED RESPONDENTS

There is NO Exit or Post-Exit interview conducted with a proxy for a deceased respondent.

## SECTION 4: CONTACTING ACL RESPONDENTS

PRE-INTERVIEW MAILING and RESPONDENT INCENTIVES
Around February 18, 2021 study staff will be mailing pre-interview letters to ACL respondents. Each
letter will include a Response Booklet, a Life History Calendar (LHC) for the respondent to complete, and
a business return envelope (BRE) for mailing the completed LHC back to SRO.
Respondents will receive their $30 token of appreciation checks in the mail after completion of an
interview. You will be responsible for requesting these checks using the Respondent Payment Tab
accessible through the View/Edit menu in SurveyTrak. These checks will be generated from the business
office. Inform the respondent that they should receive the check in the mail within a month.

## FIRST ATTEMPTS AT CONTACTING RESPONDENTS

Review previous wave Call Notes
It is important to review the call notes from the previous wave before making an attempt at first contact.
Call notes from the previous wave can be found in the Respondent Profiles. There is vital information in
the Respondent Profiles that can help you determine whether or not other steps are needed before
making a call. It is also important to be prepared to answer questions or address concerns that may
come up. Some of the respondents we spoke to in 2019 may have been resistant. There are also
respondents who have not spoken to us in 9 years or longer and may need more reassurance or
additional information on the study, etc. Being prepared and knowledgeable will help maximize your





**Keywords:** ACL-Life, SurveyTrak, Proxy Interviews, Respondent Incentives, Cognitive Impairment,  Informed Consent,  Pre-interview Mailing,  Life History Calendar
<!-- Page 11 -->


success in gaining cooperation.

## CALL NOTES

Call Notes about a contact or attempted contact with a respondent are one of the most valuable tools
an interviewer can have. As the interviewer it is your responsibility to provide complete, relevant, and
useful information in the Call Notes for each of your cases.
Many people depend on the Call Notes to gain an understanding of the interaction between the
respondent and the interviewer, which in turn is used to make adjustments for future waves of the
study.

### Call Note Insights

Call Notes are also analyzed to provide insight into successful or unsuccessful data collection
efforts. They identify calling patterns that are most successful both by region and by types of
respondents. Areas of non-response can be addressed by modifications in presentations of
questionnaire content and materials. When you review the previous wave’s Call Notes, think about what
you wish had been recorded--what would have helped you better understand your respondent. Then
include that level of detail for the next interviewer in your Call Note.
What to Include in Call Notes:
Refer to the Call Note reference sheet in Canvas for a full list of all of the essential components to be
included.
• The respondent’s or informant’s name:
This is essential in making contact with the correct person on the next call. Note the relationship to the
respondent, as well as the gender and age, if known.
• All phone numbers that are used in trying to contact the respondent or informant.
• What was said by the interviewer to the respondent/informant.
How much and what kind of information you gave to the respondent/informant.
• What was said by the respondent/informant.
Note any concerns that were expressed and whether or not your response seemed sufficient to allay the
person’s concerns.
• Action to be taken in future calls.
If an appointment was set, note the time and date. Indicate whether this was a firm appointment or





**Keywords:** Call notes, interviewer training, data collection, survey research, respondent interaction, non-response, qualitative data, quantitative data
<!-- Page 12 -->


simply a suggested time to call back.
• Other suggestions that might help get the interview.
The respondent’s normal working hours or household routines that might interfere with obtaining an
interview (e.g., meal times, children’s schedules, etc.).
• Answering machine messages.
The first time you hear an answering machine or recording, write a brief summary of the recorded
message. Make note of any changes to that message in the future.
• Be careful to type contact information accurately in call notes. Names, addresses or phone
numbers with typos can create challenges for future callers and for administrative staff.
What NOT To Include In Call Notes:
• Judgmental statements. Call notes should never contain judgmental statements, which could be
interpreted as damaging to the informant or prejudicial to other interviewers. Problems should
always be documented in an objective and neutral tone. If you are in doubt about how to record
a situation, consult with your Team Leader.
Examples of Good and Bad Call Notes
Bad: Inf was busy. Try back eves.
Good: M/inf interrupted after verifying home, said house is being remodeled. Said call back after
workmen leave around 4pm this afternoon.
Bad: Had a long chat with elderly F/inf. Wasn’t interested at first because she feels she’s too old, doesn’t
know enough, not feeling well --her objections ran the whole, usual gamut. We seemed to develop a
good rapport, shared a couple of laughs and she finally came around when I told her how we can’t
replace her (the ol’ “piece of the jigsaw puzzle” line). She said she and her sister live there -for 50 years
now. Said to call back tomorrow after church.
Good: Spoke to F/R Jane Doe who was hesitant at first, but helpful once I explained why she was
irreplaceable. I explained why it is important to talk to people her age, no right or wrong answers, study
background, convenient hours, etc. R lives with her sister Bessie. Made appt. for tomorrow after church.
Afternoons best.





**Keywords:** Call notes, interview techniques, field interviewing, qualitative research, informant contact, data collection,  research ethics
<!-- Page 13 -->


Bad: M/R, not too bright, said “I ain’t gonna do no survey for yer company and I ain’t gonna send no
money to ya’s neither.” Nothing I could say seemed to penetrate his thick skull.
Good:R John Doe was convinced we must be soliciting funds .Kept saying “I ain’t gonna do no survey, for
your company or send any money.”I tried to explain the study and its purpose several times but to no
avail. He finally just hung up.

### Contact Tips

When contacting respondents, the objective is to make each contact as efficient as possible and
minimize your time on the phone during unproductive times.
The younger respondents are likely to be working and unavailable during the daytime. You
should make your first attempts with these respondents in call slots 1, 2, or 3.
Older respondents are likely to be home during the daytime hours, so call slots 3 and 4 would
be appropriate for your first contact attempt.
Hard-to-reach respondents communication tips
When strategizing about how best to make contact with hard to reach respondents, our goal is to ensure
we are being appropriately persistent while balancing conscientiousness. It is essential that we are
persistent and strategic in our contact attempts so that we reach as many participants as possible.
Conversely, we need to keep in mind that these respondents may be very busy or have concerns that
prevent them from being receptive to our contact attempts. A perceived overstep on our part could
impact their willingness to complete the ACL-Life interview or participate in any possible future ACL
projects.
Determining level of persistence
Determining the level of persistence to us will vary by respondent. This is where relying on a variety of
modes and contact windows and being strategic about passive communications (voicemails, emails,
texts)can help. The following are some recommended guidelines for how to balance persistence &
strategy with conscientiousness when trying to reach the hard-to-reach.
Order of Recommended Contact Modes
This list, slightly updated, is a set of flexible guidelines to keep in mind as you work your cases. Listed in
order of recommended mode:
TEL – Aim for roughly 3 contacts per phone number per week, limiting voicemails to one per





**Keywords:** Respondent contact, survey research, hard-to-reach respondents, contact strategies, data collection, persistence,  telephone interviewing,  interview scheduling
<!-- Page 14 -->


phone number per week (unless sharing new information or following up on a call from R)

### Text –

Mail Use verbiage from the Hard To Reach section in text templates as needed. – Hard-to-Reach Letter
(multiple letters ok, if separated by at least 1-1.5 months)
Email – Use verbiage from the Hard To Reach section in text templates as needed.
Sending multiple emails is acceptable, if separated by 3-5 weeks.
Note: These guidelines refer to typical cases. It is appropriate, for example, to send more frequent emails
or letters to Respondents for whom we don’t have a working phone.
Hard-to-Reach Respondents – Reminders
● Remember to review the Profile to
○ confirm whether the R has agreed to be contacted by Text
○ identify any notes from the call/contact records regarding best days/times to reach the R
● Always document each attempt as an individual call record, including all modes (TEL, Text, Mail,

### Email)

● Spread any TEL and Text attempts across all call windows
● Do not hesitate to request a 1:1 with your TL/PM to strategize on individual lines and to consider
having another interviewer try from another phone number.

## WHEN CONTACT ATTEMPTS FAIL

In most cases we find that interviews are conducted within the first three contacts made to the
respondent. If you have been unable to connect with your respondent by the 6th call, please follow the
Hard-to-Reach (HTR) protocol outlined in Section 5 of this study guide.

## INTRODUCTIONS

Introductions are important, not only during initial contact, but on subsequent contacts as well. Use
your active listening techniques during all conversations with your respondents, so you can develop
introductions that address any questions or concerns the respondents may have. Remember to enter
complete Call Notes after each contact, so on future contacts you or another caller can refer to the
prior conversation. Establishing good rapport by showing respect and compassion is essential in
maintaining respondent cooperation. It is also important to remain professional in manner. Be certain
not to become overly familiar with respondents. For example, engaging in personal conversations or





**Keywords:** Respondent contact, interview techniques, hard-to-reach respondents, call tracking, communication protocols,  contact strategy,  data collection, survey methodology
<!-- Page 15 -->


offering personal advice would not be appropriate. As an interviewer, you are required to maintain a
professional relationship with all respondents.
Formulating your introduction
You have been given a great deal of information in this study guide and during training which you can
use to formulate your own introduction. Take some time to write out several introductions that you
feel will fit different situations. Practice them before you start calling respondents.
Introductions are most effective when you tailor them to the individual respondent. Information in the
Respondent Profile can help in the preparation of a tailored introduction.

## CONTACTING INFORMANTS

When you reach an informant who is having doubts about providing contact information about the
respondent, identify the issue and respond to it. Do not overwhelm an informant with explanations. It is
better to hold something back, so you have a reason to call again:
I can understand your reservations about giving out information on a close, personal friend without
checking with him first. Why don’t you contact Mr. Jones and I’ll call you back in a few days?
Remember, timing is everything! Don’t push an informant to the point he/she feels harassed. If you
sense he/she is feeling pressured, back off. Let a few days or weeks go by before you attempt contact
again, especially if you sense that he/she needs to make contact with the respondent before giving you
the requested information.

### Phone Tips

Chances are you will be talking to people who have a direct link to the respondent and to some who do
not. Some informants may be suspicious, question the legitimacy of our research or perceive contact
with you as an imposition on their time. Dealing with informants requires preparation and finesse.
The first step is to evaluate the situation and develop a strategy before you pick up the phone.
What is the best introduction I can give?
How did I obtain the informant’s name?
What are the most useful questions I can ask him or her?
What questions or objections might the informant have? How will I respond to them?

## THE PHONE INTRODUCTION

In most cases, the interviewer should introduce him or herself by establishing credentials and the





**Keywords:** Interviewer training, informant contacting, respondent interviewing, research methodology,  data collection techniques,  telephone interviewing,  introduction strategies,  professional interviewing
<!-- Page 16 -->


importance of locating the respondent for valuable research.
If the informant asks, “How did you get my name or phone number?” The interviewer should be
prepared to answer the question without hesitancy, in a matter-of-fact tone of voice.
Answers to How did you get my name or phone number
Below are examples of appropriate responses to the question:
If the informant was listed as a contact person The last time we spoke with Mrs. Smith, she told
us you were the one person she knew would always know how to locate her.
If contacting the informant was a suggestion of another individual A person I spoke with while
trying to locate [respondent’s name] suggested I contact you. The University of Michigan’s
commitment to safeguard privacy does not allow me to disclose that person’s name. Any
information you provide will also be confidential.
If the informant’s name and phone number was obtained through an electronic resource We
were able to determine you were a neighbor of [respondent’s name] in [year] by your address.
We understand this is an unusual request, but it’s important to our research that we locate
[him/her].Any information you give us will be confidential.
Warning about electronic resources
A word of warning about electronic sources: Do not volunteer that you have obtained the name or
number through an electronic source. Many people have misconceptions about electronic sources
being illegal or are uncomfortable with the amount of public information that is electronically available
today. In some cases, it may be best to start the conversation with confirmation that you are talking to
the resident of a particular address, rather than confirmation that you are speaking with a particular
person.

## PHONE MESSAGES AND DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE

Disconnected phone numbers
If you have a phone number for the respondent or contact person, call it. Record in detail the
phone company’s message. You will probably get one of the following results:
1. The number has been “disconnected.”
Listen carefully. “Temporarily disconnected” may mean that the individual has not paid a phone bill. If
you suspect that this could be the case, try the number weekly for at least a month to see if the line is





**Keywords:** Respondent location, research interviewing, informant contact, privacy concerns, data collection methods, phone message handling, electronic resources, confidentiality
<!-- Page 17 -->


reconnected. A second possibility is the number has been disconnected while an individual is on an
extended vacation or at a second home.
Line being checked for trouble
2. The number is “being checked for trouble.”
This phone company recording may mean the line has a service problem. If you receive the message
several times, it may be an indication the customer has not paid the bill. Try the number weekly for at
least a month to see if it is reconnected.
The number has been reassigned
3. The number has been “reassigned” Verify the phone number you have called. If the phone number
belongs to someone else ask the informant
4. Verify the phone number
to someone else.
you have called, including area code, with the new party. If the
number is correct, ask if there has been an area code change since the date of the respondent’s
last interview. (There have been numerous area code changes in recent years. The
respondent’s area code may have changed, but s/he may have the same seven-digit number.)
Ask, “How long have you had the number?”
Phone companies usually wait at least six months before reassigning a phone number. The respondent
may be at the same address with a new non-published number.
If the person on the line has had the number longer than the time elapsed since the respondent’s last
interview, there may be a data input error. Check the previous wave’s Call Notes for typographical errors
or a reversal of numbers.

### No Answer

5. The number rings more than 20 times but is never answered. Twenty rings usually means the
number is no longer assigned or that you have reached a pay phone. After 20 rings on assigned
numbers, you may get a recorded message, “Your party is not answering, please try your call
later.” Verify with Directory Assistance or a contact person that the number you are dialing is
the correct number for the respondent.
High pitched squeal





**Keywords:** Phone number reassignment, disconnected phone number, tracing phone numbers, telephone survey methodology, data input error,  survey research challenges,  contact tracing,  non-response
<!-- Page 18 -->


6. Calling the number produces a high pitched squeal (possibly a fax or modem. .

### Directory Assistance

• Verify the phone number with Directory Assistance. Inquire whether the respondent has
two phone numbers. If so, ask for the second number. The Directory Assistance Operator
may not know whether one of the numbers is a fax line.
• If Directory Assistance verifies that the number you have been calling is correct and it is the
only listing for the respondent, you should call in the four call time slots for at least two
weeks. Many home fax machines are used on an irregular basis.
• If after the two-week period you still get the fax line, notify your Team Leader. S/he
may authorize that a letter be sent via fax.
7. When calling the number, you get a message giving you a new number.
Call the new number.

## SCHEDULING THE INTERVIEW

The ACL interview will vary in length, depending on respondent answers. As a general rule, you should
allow up to an hour and a half between interview appointments. Keeping this in mind, schedule your
appointments early in the morning, afternoon, or evening, so it will not interfere with the respondent’s
meals or bedtime.
Be sensitive to the specific circumstances of each of your respondents. Older respondents may
have special situations that you need to accommodate.
The interview may be broken into separate sessions if it is more convenient for the respondent. If you
are in a long interview situation and you sense the respondent is getting restless, tired, or having a hard
time focusing on the questions, it is quite appropriate to offer the option of finishing the interview in
another sitting. A cautionary note: we do take a chance of the respondent not wanting to finish the rest
of the interview when it is conducted over multiple sessions. We rely on your judgment about when to
take this action.

## LOCATING RESPONDENTS

The success of the ACL study depends on locating and interviewing every respondent. High response
rates, along with quality data, are necessary to maintain the integrity of the study and researchers’
ability to apply the findings to the general population. Each respondent is extremely important as s/he is





**Keywords:** ACL interview, respondent location, phone number verification, directory assistance, scheduling interviews, interview techniques,  data collection,  research methodology
<!-- Page 19 -->


representative of thousands of others who live in the United States.

## INTERVIEWING SPECIAL POPULATIONS

There are many different types of special populations in the ACL sample. Be aware that the particular
circumstances you may encounter can add to your success. Some of the older sample respondents in
ACL will require special attention in your interactions. The following are descriptions of different
situations you may face and suggestions on how to handle them:
Physical and Cognitive Limitations
Physical limitations such as hearing loss, loss of eyesight, illness, or diminished physical endurance may
make an interview difficult. Having arthritis will make holding a phone for extended periods
burdensome; hearing loss can make phone interviews difficult or impossible. Your sensitivity to these
factors is critical, not only for “getting the interview” and obtaining high quality data but, more
importantly, for maintaining rapport and ensuring cooperation in the future.
As people grow older it is not uncommon for them to experience some cognitive changes. Changes in
cognitive functioning may be frustrating, but they do not usually affect day-to-day functioning.
Examples of memory impairments associated with the normal aging process include occasional difficulty
recalling a name or number, having to use calendars or notes about appointments, and trouble
concentrating when there is a lot of background noise such as conversations or the TV.
Some loss of mental capacity may be due to degenerative impairments such as Alzheimer’s disease. In
its early stages, it may be difficult to assess; however, later stages will be fairly obvious.

## GATEKEEPERS

Who are Gatekeepers
A “gatekeeper” is an individual who acts as a barrier to direct contact with a respondent.
When interviewing respondents in this age group, the most likely gatekeepers you will find are family
members who provide live-in or continual care for their aging relative.
The gatekeeper may be the spouse; adult child/child-in-law; a close relative such as a sister or brother,
a grandchild, or even a neighbor; or professional caregiver. Women are more likely than men to have
the major responsibility of caring for an elderly person. Spouses (usually older females) are the most
common caregivers, followed by daughters, and then daughters-in-law.

### Understanding Gatekeepers’ Concerns






**Keywords:** Special populations, interviewing techniques, elderly interviews, cognitive impairment, gatekeepers, Alzheimer's disease,  physical limitations, survey methodology
<!-- Page 20 -->


Gatekeepers are genuinely concerned and are trying to protect the respondent from situations with
which the gatekeeper thinks the respondent will be unable to cope. Caregivers can themselves be
subject to stress and exhaustion. You must be sensitive to the situation. However, gatekeepers are
not always correct in their assessment of the respondent’s ability to engage in an interview.

### Overcoming Gatekeeper Concerns

Try to establish rapport with gatekeepers; listen to their concerns, and respond with understanding
as well as information. If the respondent has asked that you speak to the gatekeeper, you may use
more latitude in determining the amount of study information you share. Tell such gatekeepers
about the study and its importance. Let them know that you would appreciate it if they could “assist”
by being there when the interview takes place. They can even help to answer some of the questions
in the interview (an assisted interview). Reassure them that if the interview becomes a burden to the
respondent, the gatekeeper may ask that the interview be completed another day.
You may also find respondents who are following the advice of an absent gatekeeper. If you make
contact with a reluctant respondent who explains that he or she has been advised by children or
someone else not to talk to anyone, let him or her know you understand the concerns. Ask if you
may have the address of the gatekeeper, so you can send information about the study directly to the
gatekeeper. If the respondent refuses to provide this information, ask him or her to take down the
toll-free phone number. The gatekeeper can check the number with the operator and also call the
number and ask questions about the study.
Please stress to both the respondent and the gatekeeper the confidentiality of the research. Any
identifying information will be kept separate from the interview. Only summary statistics will be
reported. Also stress the importance of the research. Many gatekeepers have become allies in
getting respondents to do interviews. Remember to provide the gatekeeper/respondent with the
toll-free phone line as needed.

### Gatekeeper Summary

To summarize:
• The gatekeeper acts as a barrier to direct contact with a respondent.
• Be sure to maintain good rapport with all informants on all contacts with a household, just
in case you should have to enlist their help as an assistant or proxy respondent.





**Keywords:** Gatekeepers, respondent interviews, research methodology, overcoming gatekeeper objections, qualitative research, data collection, sensitive interviews, confidentiality
<!-- Page 21 -->


• Remember that all reports of a respondent being incapable of doing an interview are not
necessarily accurate. Some individuals are simply protecting an elderly loved one from
situations they feel the respondent cannot or should not have to handle.
• Fully explain the study to the gatekeeper and stress the importance of speaking directly with
the respondent.
• Offer to allow the gatekeeper to sit in on the interviewing session to make sure questions
are appropriate and the respondent is comfortable. The caretaker or gatekeeper may
become an assistant, helping the respondent with answers if s/he has trouble remembering.
• Never attempt to circumvent gatekeepers to reach respondents. Respect their desire to protect
the respondent and work to convince them of the significance of the study and the
respondent’s participation.

## NONRESPONSE ISSUES

People are becoming more reluctant to participate in surveys. Losing the representative nature of the
survey due to high nonresponse is something that is taken very seriously—the validity of the study
will be challenged if we experience a high percentage of nonresponse.
We must identify the reasons that respondents are reluctant to participate, but it is difficult to tease
out the issues that play a part in nonresponse. The more detailed information we can gather about the
circumstances of our uncooperative respondents, the better we can make adjustments that will lead to
greater success in future waves.

## PROBLEMS WITH NONRESPONSE IN A PANEL STUDY

While nonresponse is a critical issue for all studies, it is even more so with a panel study. Meaningful
results are only possible when we are able to observe the same people over a long period of time. If we
fail to retain a very high percentage of our respondents, or if the reporter of information within the
household does not remain constant, we jeopardize our ability to observe real change, and become
unable to provide the information the ACL study was designed and funded to address.
After being interviewed multiple times, respondents may question our need to ask them the same
questions they have answered in the past, especially when there have been few changes in their lives.
They might say that they were unaware that ACL would be an ongoing activity or that they have less
time for an interview now than they had at previous waves.





**Keywords:** Survey Methodology, Nonresponse Bias, Panel Study, Gatekeepers, Respondent Reluctance,  Data Collection,  ACL Study, Interviewing Techniques
<!-- Page 22 -->


It is essential that we listen to and tackle every concern expressed by respondents. We need to fully
explain why we conduct panel studies and the importance of their continued participation; although
their situation may not have changed, the circumstances of other people’s lives have. Only by
combining their answers with others’ can we establish a broad picture of how the country as a whole
is changing.

## AVERSION TECHNIQUES

The maxim, “The best defense is a good offense,” holds true in interviewing. Aversion skills will be one
of your most powerful tools. Being prepared before attempting contact and being astute while you are
communicating with your respondent will greatly increase your chances of success.
This section offers suggestions that come directly from interviewers, who after years of experience have
learned how to engage respondents and gain their cooperation.

### Gaining Cooperation Tips

Get the respondent’s attention
This is the crucial objective. Clearly identify yourself and the University of Michigan. Briefly state the
purpose of the call.
Establish a dialogue.
If you can get the informant/respondent involved in a dialogue, you are far more likely to gain his/her
cooperation. This does not mean asking, “How are you today?” That
phrase is the single biggest mistake that telemarketers make. Introduce yourself and the study briefly,
without giving more information than the respondent needs. If he/she needs more information, he/she
will ask. If you can get the respondent to ask a question, you are halfway in the door, so to speak.
If you are lucky enough to be calling a respondent whom you have interviewed before,
you can say something like, “I’ve been looking forward to talking to you again.”
If the respondent lives in an area that has been in the news lately, you can say, “I thought about you
when I heard about the floods in your area.”
Build your knowledge of the study
Sources of knowledge include information you receive at training and the material contained in this
study guide. If you are familiar with this material, it will build your self-confidence.
Anticipate common questions
Anticipate common comments, questions, and concerns, and write out explanations in your own words.
Some suggested introductory sentences for common resistance comments are included in the next
section. Specific questions you should be prepared for are:





**Keywords:** Panel studies, Interviewing techniques, Respondent cooperation, Aversion techniques, Survey methodology,  Qualitative research, Data collection,  University of Michigan
<!-- Page 23 -->


“What is this information used for, anyway?”
“I don’t see that this benefits me.”
“Who’s paying for this study?”
“Why do you need to interview me?”
“I’ve been doing this long enough. Get someone else.”
“My answers are always the same—just use the last interview”.
Build your knowledge of the respondent
This cannot be overemphasized. Before you call, review the Respondent Profile. You should feel that you
know the respondent before you ever pick up the phone.
Use active listening techniques
Listen closely to what the respondent is saying, rephrase what has been said, and verbally reflect it back.
Listen to what is not being said, and be prepared to address it. If the respondent says something like,
“We’ve decided not to participate anymore,” you may need to tease out whether the problem is the
length of the interview, the nature of the questions, something going on in the respondent’s life, or
something else altogether.
Focus on every respondent as an individual
We all face challenges in our lives and respondents
are no exception. All of those stresses in their lives are real to them, so be prepared to work with
them. It may help to remind them that these are the very things that we are trying to capture
because of their impact on the well-being of the families.
Maintain professionalism, but be pleasant
Be confident, courteous, and sympathetic. Put a sincere smile in your voice, and maintain a pleasant
conversational tone. Be assertive, but not aggressive. Never argue with a respondent.
Timing is everything
Don’t push the respondent to the point that s/he feels harassed. When you sense that a respondent is
feeling pressured, back off! Let a few days, or even weeks, go by before you contact the respondent
again, especially if they mentioned something—a move, harvest season, illness—that is genuinely taking
his/her attention right now. However, once the point is reached that a persuasion letter is sent, follow up
promptly to maintain the sense of urgency.
Leave the door open
The most important aspect of good aversion techniques is to leave the door open. When you reach a
respondent who is having some doubts, do not unload all of your ammunition at once. Respond to what





**Keywords:** Respondent interviewing, qualitative research, interview techniques, active listening, respondent relations, data collection, research methodology, survey methodology
<!-- Page 24 -->


seems to be the issue, but do not overwhelm the respondent with reasons or explanations – better to
hold something back so you have a reason to call again.
Always end on a positive note
Leave all contacts with something positive, even if it is nothing more than your suggestion that the
respondent gives it some more thought, or the idea that you will talk with him or her again later. Even if
the refusal is final, be pleasant, and sincerely thank the respondent for the contribution he or she has
made over the years.

## CONVERSION TECHNIQUES

When you are calling to persuade reluctant respondents, acknowledge their concerns and reflect back
what they said on previous calls.
1. I know that you told us that you were very busy. I was hoping that your schedule might have
freed up a bit.
2. Be as specific as possible. You mentioned that you were busy getting ready for your daughter’s
wedding. I was hoping that now would be a better time for you.
3. I know that you said you aren’t interested in doing this study anymore, but I wanted to share
with you some of the ways that the research is used. (Be prepared with some brief examples.)
In other words, we heard what the respondent said before—it is not that we are bothering
him/her because we are not listening, it is because participation is so important. Persuade him that
it is important for him/her, or for society, if he/she does not care that it is important to us.
The following are some examples of opening sentences:
1. I’m calling to find out if there has been any misunderstanding.
2. We called you before, and I think we may have caught you at a bad time.
3. I know we have called you before. I wouldn’t be calling you again, but I wanted you to know
how important you are to our research. (Give an example or two.)
4. I do apologize for having to contact your household again, but I really need your help.
5. I’m sorry to call you at suppertime (so early, on a Sunday), but we’ve had a hard time
reaching you. (If a respondent has been evasive.)

## ANSWERS TO OBJECTIONS

Sometimes a respondent’s reluctance may reflect a bad experience with a previous contact, and you
may need to ferret that out in order to address it effectively. Here are some of the concerns that





**Keywords:** Persuasion techniques, respondent conversion,  reluctant respondent,  sales calls,  research participation,  positive closing,  call back strategies
<!-- Page 25 -->


may be expressed, or implied, and some possible answers:
• “I’m tired of so many different interviewers calling.”
I’m sorry to hear that has happened to you. Sometimes that happens when we’re very busy. I’ll
make every effort to be sure I’m the only interviewer calling you this year. What is the best time
for you to complete the interview?
• “The last interview was too long.”
The length of the interview is sometimes longer when you’ve had some major changes in
your life, or because you had a lot of valuable information to share with us. I’m a very
experienced and professional interviewer, and I’ll make every effort to move it along quickly
OR I’m confident I can move it along quickly OR I’d be glad to do it in smaller segments, if
that would be more convenient for you. This may help a respondent who is not well or has a
hard time holding the receiver for long periods of time.
• “The questions last year were too personal.”
Remind the respondent that they are free to refuse any question they do not want to
answer, even though it is all valuable for our research. You can remind the respondent of the
confidentiality of their answers and that their information is only released with that of other
respondents.
• “You ask me the same questions every time”
I know that it can sometimes seem repetitive, but that’s the only way that we can capture the
subtle changes in people’s circumstances over time. Our questions may sound the same, but
your answers are always different. And it’s also important for our data to reflect stable
situations.

## APPROACHES FOR SPECIFIC REFUSALS

“I’m too busy.” or “I don’t have time.”
• Listen carefully—is the respondent saying he/she does not have time right now, or is this
a chronic condition?
• If the respondent is very busy right now, or for a foreseeable time in the future, be prepared
to work with her.
• I can imagine that this is really a busy time for farmers— when is planting season over? I





**Keywords:** Interview techniques, respondent refusal, survey methodology, data collection, qualitative research, interviewee objections,  handling objections
<!-- Page 26 -->


could call you then.
• Oh, we’d be glad to call after the wedding – what would be a better time for you?
If the respondent is chronically busy, be prepared to offer some options:
• I’d be glad to call on a weekend, or early in the morning.
• We could do it in two parts, if that would help.
• I could call you at your work place, or somewhere else, if that would be more convenient. In
fact, many busy people would rather set a time to do it at their work place.
The respondent says he/she is not feeling well or is caring for a sick person.
• If the respondent appears to be chronically and/or seriously ill, you may need to speak with
another family member to assess if an assisted interview would be more appropriate.
The respondent is hard of hearing.
• IS THIS BETTER IF I SPEAK LOUDER? CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW? Louder is sometimes worse.
Also, try using the handset instead of the headset.
• Would it be better if I spoke more slowly, or could you hear a (man’s/woman’s) voice better?
People are sometimes hearing impaired only in a certain range of sounds.
• Try calling back in the morning—some people may hear more clearly early in the day.
• If the respondent lives in an area available to an interviewer, send the case for a
face-to-face interview.
The respondent hangs up on you.
• If there is uncertainty about how the disconnection occurred, redial and reply, “I’m sorry our
call was cut off. We sometimes have trouble with our phone lines,” and pick up the interview
from the disconnection point.
• If you are certain that the other party disconnected the call and you were already into the
interview, write comments and suggestions in the call notes, and attempt a refusal
conversion on another call.
You always get an answering machine.
• Do not leave a message the first couple of times.
• Do not leave a message on the answering machine for a refusal conversion case, unless you
are calling for an appointment and the respondent does not answer the phone.





**Keywords:** telephone interviewing, interview techniques, respondent challenges, call refusal conversion,  handling difficult respondents,  assisted interviews,  phone survey methodology
<!-- Page 27 -->


• On about the third call, state who you are, and that you are calling from the University of
Michigan. (Again remembering confidentiality – you can’t be certain who is listening to
your messages.
• Don’t leave a message on every call – it’s annoying.
• Give it a couple of weeks, and, if at that point you haven’t reached anyone, you may begin
to suspect one of two things:
1. The residents of the household may be gone for an extended period of time – vacation,
wintering out, illness. It might be a good idea to try reaching the contacts to find out if the
respondent is still at the number we have or if we should try them at another number.
After you have introduced yourself, use language such as, “We’ve been trying to contact
them for a couple of weeks. Do you know how we might contact them?” Asking if the
respondent is away from home might alarm the contact person.
2. The household may be screening their calls and are not interested in speaking with us.
You can try leaving the toll-free number a couple of times, asking them to call us to
arrange a good time for an interview. Sometimes if you call back immediately after you
have been getting a busy signal, the household will answer, thinking you are the same
party calling back. Some people screen their calls only at certain times, like dinnertime or
during a favorite TV show. Calling at a different time, like early morning, might work.

## USE OF PERSUASION LETTERS

Persuasion letters can be an extremely useful tool in converting respondents if used properly. Only
use them when all possible refusal conversion attempts in the field have failed. Once a persuasion
letter has been used, we generally have only one more opportunity to call back the reluctant
respondent to persuade him or her to complete an interview.
Requesting a persuasion letter
If you feel a situation requires a persuasion letter, discuss the case thoroughly with your Team Leader. If
you and your Team Leader decide that a letter should be sent:
Accessing the letter request form
1. You will be able to access the Letter Request Form





**Keywords:** Survey Methodology, Telephone Interviewing, Respondent Refusal, Persuasion Letters, Call-Back Strategies, Interview Techniques, Data Collection
<!-- Page 28 -->


electronically through SurveyTrak. The Letter Request Form can be viewed by selecting a sample line and
then selecting “Letters” through the Edit menu.
2. In the Letter Type field select “Other” from the drop down menu. Be sure to specify which letter type
is being requested.
3. Once the Letter Request Form has been accessed, you will be able to enter the information.
Necessary to submit a letter request. You must obtain approval from your Team Leader prior to
submitting a special letter request
4. Monitor this line periodically to learn when the persuasion letter was mailed. The “Letter Sent
Date” is located in the Letter Request Form.
Persuasion letter follow-up
5. Plan on making a follow-up visit or phone call about one week after the letter was sent. A Personal
visit is preferable if the respondent is within traveling distance. You must receive TL approval before
making a face-to-face visit.
6. Be aware that the shipping time from Ann Arbor to different parts of the country varies widely. The
effectiveness of persuasion letters in refusal conversion is lost if the follow-up is not timely

## TAILORING APPROACHES FOR SUCCESS

Customize your approach
Each respondent and each situation you encounter will be different the information you have from the
previous wave through the Respondent Profile or your contacts with the respondent this wave. As each
respondent is different, each contact with a respondent might also be different.
Keep detailed documentation in the Call Notes on the methods you have tried and their outcome. The
more information available, the better your chances are for finding the right key to unlock the door to
success.
Transfer to another interviewer
Another very successful approach is to transfer the resistant case to another interviewer. Often just a
change in person, for whatever reason, is enough to turn an uncooperative respondent into a
cooperative one. Giving the case to someone who will approach it from a different perspective can mean
the difference between gaining an interview or losing one. Work closely with the other interviewers in
your work group and with your Team Leader to strategize a range of approaches, including transferring
cases. Using the group’s many years of experience with this and other studies is guaranteed to ensure
the most positive outcome.

## SECTION 5: HARD TO REACH (HTR) AND LOCATING


## FLAGGED CASES

There are approximately 87 sample cases flagged by the Study Office as Hard to Reach (HTR). The “HTR”





**Keywords:** SurveyTrak, Persuasion Letters, Respondent Follow-up, Interviewer Training, Refusal Conversion, Data Collection,  Team Leader Approval,  Call Notes
<!-- Page 29 -->


(hard to reach) respondents have not participated since Wave 3 (1994) and were hard to reach in
ACL-Wave 6. There are about 125 additional sample cases in the ACL-Life sample that are not flagged as
“HTR,” however they will likely require locating.
The specifics of the locating workflow will be provided separately in Canvas.

## SECTION 6: TLC AND MANAGING RESISTANCE

The “TLC” (tender loving care) cases are respondents who refused participation in past waves (e.g., used
language like “stop calling,” “I’m not interested,” “don’t call me again”). There are approximately 49
cases flagged as TLC. These Rs were included in the October 2020 ACL newsletter mailing, but follow-up
effort will be limited.
TLC procedures:
1. After 6 failed attempts without reaching R (or an Informant who can confirm phone number is
valid) refer case (SID) to TL for review.
2. Or if Iwer reaches R and receives resistance, refer case (SID) to TL for review.
3. TL reviews case to assess and determine whether all possible leads have been attempted.
a. TL will review Respondent Profile for previous wave participation and determine next
steps.

### Addressing Respondent Concerns

Identify study-level resistance
Here is our general approach to handling any new instances of potential ACL study-level resistance we
encounter in our work.
1. Interviewers will identify / respond to potential study-level resistance:
a. Rely on active listening to identify respondent concerns and use standard techniques to
address these concerns. If Respondent expresses resistance, Interviewer attempts to understand R’s
concerns and works to address them; if no reasons given for declining to participate, interviewer asks
these questions:
Questions to ask if respondent expresses resistance
(1) “Why?” and (2) “If there is anything we can do to accommodate your concerns (e.g. timing, burden,
etc.), we’ll work hard to do so.” (Tailor remainder of response to R’s concerns.)
b. After acknowledging R’s concerns, listen for responses that indicate whether she is
seeking to withdraw from (1) the study at large, or (2) whether she'd like to skip current





**Keywords:** Respondent Resistance, Hard-to-Reach Respondents, Survey Methodology, Data Collection, Longitudinal Study,  ACL Study,  Refusal Conversion,  Interviewer Training
<!-- Page 30 -->


ACL-Life interview?
Procedures if respondent expresses resistance
c. At conclusion of conversation with R, Interviewer suspends further work and consults
with Team Leader.
d. Interviewer documents conversation / reasons for resistance in call records and code as
4301 or 4302, and state details in the Interviewer Observations.
e. If potential study level resistance comes from an informant communicate to the
informant that we must speak with the R themselves to confirm, then continue the
effort to speak with R directly. Document in call record and contact observations.
2. Interview Team Lead (e.g. SRO team) reviews notes and makes determination how to proceed,
seeking input or final decision from PM when appropriate:
3. Final Determination of Result Code:
Where appropriate, Terri and Pooja will continue discussion
with Study Office about our recommended best practices regarding fielding / addressing
respondent concerns.

## SECTION 7: RESPONDENT / INTERVIEWER SUPPORT


## CLINICAL CONTACT PROGRAM (CCP)

Respondent support
(Full text extracted from the “Respondent and Interviewer Support Protocol – Updated July 2019”
document on the SRO Intranet)
This section describes general procedures that apply to all research studies involving interactions with
respondents. Individual studies may require additional procedures which are covered in study-specific
training.
The Survey Research Center is committed to providing support to respondents and to interviewers. We
understand that the job of the interviewer involves interacting with respondents in our studies.
Sometimes the questions we ask may sometimes call up mild or stronger emotions in both the
respondents and the interviewers. During in-person interviews, field interviewers observe what goes
on in respondent homes and even during telephone interviews interviewers may hear or be told of
difficult situations in respondents’ lives.

We have established specific protocols to help interviewers respond appropriately to these types of
situations. The most important thing for an interviewer to know is that you have the support of the
University of Michigan Survey Research Center. In general, you should not and are not expected to
handle these issues alone. We will outline the protocol for handling the type of situations that you
may encounter:

### 1. Emergencies


### 2. Distressed Respondents

3. Reporting Possible Abuse or Other Situations
4. Getting Help for Yourself

### Emergencies

When interviewing in a respondent’s home, you may observe a situation which warrants immediate
action on your part. Though very rare, should you ever witness a violent crime, a child or anyone else
in immediate danger, or any other similar situation where not calling the local police or fire
department would endanger the lives of the people living in the respondent’s household, call the local
authorities immediately.
As soon as possible after you have done this, please contact your production manager. If you cannot
immediately reach your production manager, please call the SRO toll-free number (1-800-759-7947)
and ask to speak with your project leader. If he or she is not available, please ask to speak with one of
the members of the Survey Research Operations (SRO) management team.
It is highly unlikely that you will ever be involved in such a situation. If there is any ambiguity about the
severity of the situation, please call your production manager first, before taking any action. We want
to protect the privacy of the respondents and members of their households, but not at the cost of the
safety of individuals. However, when interacting with authorities in an emergency situation please
remember not to identify the study you work on or disclose a respondent’s participation in our
research.

### Distressed Respondents

Although our experience shows this happens rarely, sometimes when a questionnaire includes
sensitive topics, some respondents may experience distress during or after an interview. You should





**Keywords:** Interviewer training, emergency protocols, respondent safety, survey research, distress, abuse reporting, University of Michigan, Survey Research Operations (SRO)
<!-- Page 32 -->


familiarize yourself with this protocol so that you are comfortable handling these types of situations
when they do occur:
1. You should never try to advise the respondent. If the respondent is too upset to continue the
interview, you should take the following steps:
a. Convey to the respondent that you are sorry that they are upset and that you will wait
until they are ready to continue. If the interview is in-person and the respondent is
crying, you may wish to offer a piece of Kleenex or ask if she/he wants to get a drink of
water. Give the respondent ample time to compose him or herself.
b. If the respondent is not able to proceed after a few minutes or if he or she asks you for
help, you should say “I’m not trained to help you with this situation, but the University
has help available for you that is confidential. We have someone associated with our
study who is specifically available for this purpose. Would you like me to have that
person give you a call? She will contact you soon and talk to you and if you need
further help, she will help you find a resource in your area.”
c. In the very rare situation where the respondent mentions that he/she is thinking of
hurting himself/herself or others, you must tactfully end the interview and tell the
respondent that you will be contacting someone from the Clinical Contact team to call
them as soon as possible. You should ask the respondent for a number where they
can be reached within the next 24-48 hours. If the threat of suicide is immediate,
contact 9-1-1 first. (This is highly unlikely. We mention it here only so that you will
know what to do if it ever does occur.)
2. If the respondent is able, make an appointment to complete the interview at a later time. If not,
let him or her know you’ll follow up in a few days.
3. The next step is to contact the Clinical Contact Team. To do this, complete and submit the
CCP Referral Form. A Clinical Contact Team member will then contact you within 24-48 hours
by telephone to gather more detailed information about the Respondent.
4. In cases where the respondent shows some distress, but is able to continue with the
interview, you still may offer this service to him or her at the end of the interview.
5. You may contact the CC Team about a respondent even if you did not talk about this





**Keywords:** Interview protocol, respondent distress, crisis intervention,  clinical contact team,  suicide prevention, mental health support, CCP Referral Form
<!-- Page 33 -->


possibility with the respondent. Sometimes you may not be fully aware of your concern
about a respondent until a day or two after the interview. Please note that all members of
the CC Team have signed the ISR Pledge of Confidentiality and are bound by it.
Reporting Possible Abuse or Other Situations
There may be times when you are at a respondent’s house that you may observe suspected abuse,
neglect or endangerment of someone in the household. These situations can be very upsetting. If you
feel or even suspect that you have observed abuse, you should immediately send an email to
SAintakeForm@umich.edu, or follow the link on the Interviewer Website. Provide only your name,
phone number and a good time to reach you. A triage member will contact you to complete a
Suspected Abuse Intake Form (SAIF). The SAIF will notify SRO’s triage team to immediately contact you
to set up a meeting. In this meeting, you and the SRO triage team will review the SAIF and determine
how to respond to the incident and if necessary, fulfill appropriate reporting requirements.
If you are considered a mandated reporter in your state, after the triage process, you may also
separately file a report of suspected abuse following the guidelines of the state in which you are a
mandated reporter. You are required to notify SRO that you intend to file (or have filed) a report and
provide documentation of the report and the respondent information released. SRO is obligated to
notify the research team and the Survey Research Center, and may need to notify the IRB that a report
has been filed and that respondent confidentiality has been broken.
As outlined in our Human Subjects Protection training, there are individuals who require additional
protection (including pregnant women, minor children and the elderly). If you interview a respondent
who requests help, but indicates that he or she does not want to communicate with their caregiver
about the problem, or if you see something involving a person in the home that concerns you (this
person may or may not be a respondent in the study), complete a SAIF form. Each situation will be
reviewed and handled on a case-by-case basis.
Getting Help for Yourself
Interviewers living in Michigan
Sometimes survey questions may upset you, and cause you to remember or think about things from
your life, your family’s life or your close friends’ lives. If you, yourself, need assistance in handling any
relationship, emotional or work-place upset, you can contact the Faculty and Staff Counseling and

nseling-consultation-services/faculty-staff-counseling-consultation-office-fascco.
Interviewers living outside of Michigan
If you are an employee living outside of Michigan, you and your adult dependents can access
confidential, short-term counseling services (up to five sessions) at no charge by calling ComPsych toll
free, 844-206-1126 (TTY: 800-697-0353). You can speak by phone with a clinician or be referred to a
counselor or other resource in your area.
In situations where you are upset due to something that has happened in the course of interviewing,
you should always contact your production lead. Your production lead will help you triage the
situation and determine the best next steps, or is available to listen to your concerns.
Anytime you contact FASSCO for yourself, the service is kept strictly confidential.

## SECTION 9: SURVEYTRAK

We are using field SurveyTrak as the sample management system for the ACL-Life study. You can review
the basic functionality of SurveyTrak in the GIT SurveyTrak11 Manual.
In addition, we have the ACL-Life Study-Specific SurveyTrak Manual available for your reference. It
highlights key study-specific sample management tools and utilities. These resources are intended to
help you use SurveyTrak to manage your work as an interviewer and transmit your work to the Ann
Arbor database.
Note: Your assigned sample consists of the selected cases that you will contact and interview.

## SECTION 10: FIELD STUDY PROCEDURES


## STAFFING STRUCTURE

The ACL-Life remote staff structure is designed to promote an atmosphere of team spirit, diversity, and
productivity with the focus on a national team effort. This environment will allow flexibility in managing
the sample and providing the needed support to the interviewers and to the project demands.
Each interviewer will be part of a Team Leader group. Team leaders will report directly to production
manager Pooja Varma-Laughlin. Pooja will also function as the liaison between the SSL and
Field-affiliated staff and SRO project management team led by Terri Ridenour. Debra Heier will function
as the project manager and is responsible for a variety of tasks; including materials and respondent
payment and other related respondent mailing issues.





**Keywords:** ACL-Life Study, SurveyTrak, Interviewer Training, Sample Management,  Pooja Varma-Laughlin, Terri Ridenour, Debra Heier,  Qualitative Data Collection
<!-- Page 37 -->


The SRO staff works closely with the data collection team. A major benefit to this approach is that we
all gain the ability to understand, communicate, and implement the necessary project activities to
better meet the goals and challenges of the study. The management team is there to ensure we can
successfully carry out the data collection efforts needed to meet the goals of ACL-Life.

## EMPLOYEE COMMITMENT STATEMENT

Each interviewer is required to sign the Employee Commitment Statement prior to the start
of production.
In signing this statement, you are agreeing to meet the commitments that are described within it.
This statement also describes what we will provide to you to make you successful on ACL-Life.

## INTERVIEWER REQUIREMENTS

• Maintain 16 hours per week to the project, as sample warrants.
• Maintain the required weekly production levels.
• Maintain accurate and up-to-date SurveyTrak data as well as other related tasks.
• Maintain daily time (e.g. weekly submission of cost data).
• Enter time using an electronic timekeeping system (Tenrox/ET) and daily and submit weekly
timesheets.
• Complete daily SurveyTrak transmissions unless arrangements are made otherwise with
assigned Team Leader.
• Meet quality and cost expectations (including meeting average Hours Per Interview (HPI)
no higher than outlined by the study objectives).
• Maintain a professional and ethical manner whenever on University of Michigan business.

## GETTING PREPARED

An essential factor of success is preparation. Be sure you have thoroughly studied this study guide and
understand the concepts and procedures required of the project. Organize your materials and verify
that you have everything you will need to get off on the right foot.
It is necessary that you begin your assignment as soon after training as possible. A quick start to
production interviewing will help solidify the concepts and procedures you learned during
training.

## NOTES FROM TRAINING






**Keywords:** ACL-Life, data collection, interviewer requirements, SurveyTrak, Employee Commitment Statement,  Tenrox/ET,  timekeeping, HPI (Hours Per Interview)
<!-- Page 38 -->


During your training you will have taken notes. Questions will come up during these trainings that
may not be covered or adequately explained in this reference guide. There is a lot of information to
absorb during the training for ACL-Life. It is important to review all your notes, as well as the study
guide, again after training. Doing a thorough review afterwards will help ensure that you are ready to
begin work on the project.

## CERTIFICATION INTERVIEW REQUIREMENTS

After training and prior to the start of production screening or interviewing, all interviewers are
required to pass a certification interview. It provides confirmation that you have learned the necessary
skills for interviewing. Each of you will be assigned to join one certification session with your team
leader.

## RECEIVING AND REVIEWING YOUR ASSIGNMENTS

When you start your work after training, please begin by reviewing your sample
assignment in SurveyTrak and becoming familiar with your sample assignments. This is also
a good time to carefully review the information provided in the Respondent Profiles. This
information will give you an opportunity to get to know your sample and begin formulating
some ideas on approaches that may be successful.

## PLANNING AND SCHEDULING

Knowing in advance how you will attack your assignment will maximize your efficiency. Organize
your sample so you can work in large blocks of time.
Precontact mailing or correspondence returned
Note: Whenever the SRO office receives materials back from either the precontact mailing or
correspondence from respondents, you will be informed. If the precontact envelope and materials are
returned, we inform you via email the same day we receive them. Often these come back with an
address correction but the forwarding time might have expired, or there might be other notations
from the local post office. If the preprinted checks are returned in the precontact mailing, the SRO
staff will log the information in the Respondent Contact Logging System (RCLS).
You will be informed about the relevant content of any correspondence and what action, if any, you
need to take. This information will be sent to you via the RCLS system, or passed along to you
through your Team Leader. The same will be true of any calls that are received on the toll-free





**Keywords:** ACL-Life, Certification Interview, Interviewer Training, SurveyTrak, Respondent Profiles, Precontact Mailing, Project Planning, Sample Assignments
<!-- Page 39 -->


phone number from respondents.
Use of SurveyTrak Planner
You will be expected to use your planner in SurveyTrak at least once a week to indicate your
projected hours for the work week ahead.

## PRODUCTION GOALS –INTERVIEWS AND COST OF INTERVIEWS

Our overall national production goals for ACL-Life are approximately 1,026 completed interviews with a
response rate of 80%. Our average hours-per interview (HPI) goal is 5. Your Team Leader will discuss
your weekly goals; based on your individual sample assignment.

## MONITORING YOUR SAMPLE

During data collection, monitoring your sample is a big part of essential quality control. Make sure you
are on top of each sample line and the action that needs to be taken. If the line is not yet finalized,
have you followed procedures as outlined in this study guide? Have you completed your Call Notes
with the detail that is expected? Do you have any lines which have not been worked enough or not
worked in a timely manner? Are you properly following through on any locating cases in your
assignment? Are status and result codes being used properly? These are all necessary parts of
maintaining the quality of the data collection, in addition to gaining the respondent’s cooperation and
carefully entering the data given by your respondent.

## MONITORING YOUR PROGRESS

Using SurveyTrak Reports
To help you monitor where you are in relation to the goals, SurveyTrak has a feature allowing you to
receive and view progress reports on a regular basis. To view the reports, click the Reports button
found on your SurveyTrak main screen. From this function you will see a list of the different reports
that have been sent to you through SurveyTrak. These reports are updated each time a Send/Receive
is conducted. Simply double click on the report you would like to view. The Reports function will give
you a summary of your sample on an individual basis and on a national level.

### Reporting Your Progress


### Weekly Conference Calls

Team leaders will gather production information from interviewers during weekly conference calls.
On these calls, interviewers generally report their time, expenses, and interviews completed for the





**Keywords:** SurveyTrak, data collection, interview monitoring, progress reports, response rate, ACL-Life, quality control, sample management
<!-- Page 40 -->


week. Check with your Team Leader for the exact data you will be asked to provide on the weekly
calls as well as the time and phone number for the calls.
Typically, before each call, the facilitator will send an e-mail reminding everyone of the time, the
phone number, and a brief outline of the agenda. Often interviewers are asked to take an active role
in facilitating parts of the agenda and many times everyone’s participation is requested.
Be prepared with the information in the order and format requested by your team leader. You
will discuss national production goals and progress, as well as individual goals and progress.
Report calls will frequently focus on a specific area of interviewing, (e.g. refusal aversion,
informative call notes, etc.).
Email and phone contact throughout the week
Throughout the week, each of you will be in contact with your team leader by phone and e-mail. At
these times, you will be able to discuss in more detail issues specific to your own sample. Call on the
experience of your team leader when you are unsure how to proceed with a difficult case. Your team
leader is available to assist you with clarification of procedures, suggestions for refusal
aversion/conversion, and locating, as well as any other issues you may face as an interviewer. During
individual calls, your team leader will discuss your own progress in terms of cost and hours per
interview, production rate, and general sample management. Your team leader will also discuss your
interview evaluations, as well as emailing a copy of the evaluation to you.
Since the Interviewers play the most vital role of any on the project, we are dedicated toward
providing you with a work environment that is not only supportive but one in which everyone is
given the opportunity to succeed and to grow.

## QUALITY CONTROL PROCEDURES

Evaluating and Verifying Production Interviews
There are a number of ways in which we monitor the quality of our data collection efforts. Our
definition of quality embodies many aspects ranging from the interviewing team, the questionnaire
and support materials, performance of the questionnaire application, management of the sample, and
the data that are collected. We all share responsibility for the quality of all aspects of the data
collection process. Below are some of the specific responsibilities that each of us shares in this process.
Team Leader reviews





**Keywords:** Team Leader, Interviewer Training, Weekly Report Calls, Refusal Aversion, Data Collection, Quality Control, Production Goals, Interview Evaluation
<!-- Page 41 -->


As you monitor and review your work so will your team leader. She will frequently review your Call
Records and make sure you have a successful experience on ACL-Life.

### Verification Team Reviews

A portion of your interviews will also be evaluated and verified. Your production interviews will be
digitally recorded for quality control purposes. A percentage of these will be randomly selected for
evaluation.
Criteria for evaluating interviews
Evaluations will be based on SRO GIT standards and will include the following:

### Question Reading

Verbatim Emphasis (when called for) Pace Pronunciation

### Probing


### Inappropriate Appropriate Failure


### Feedback

Standard Non-standard Frequency Length

### Data Entry


### Verbatim Wrong Appropriate

Verifications from Respondents
A verification form will be sent to all study panel members in the pre-interview mailing and returned to
the Ann Arbor team in the pre-paid envelope provided.
Verification questions include the following:
1. Were you recently interviewed by an Interviewer from the University of Michigan for the

### Americans’ Changing Lives Study?

2. When did the interview take place?
3. About how long did the interview take?
4. In your opinion, did the interviewer conduct himself/herself in a professional manner?
5. Please enter any additional comments that you want to share about the interview or the
interviewer.
This form provides an opportunity for us to hear complimentary comments about the professionalism
and courtesy of the interviewer, and it is an opportunity for us to find out whether or not there are areas





**Keywords:** ACL-Life, Interviewer Evaluation, Quality Control, SRO GIT Standards, Call Records, Respondent Verification,  Data Entry,  Americans' Changing Lives Study
<!-- Page 42 -->


where we can improve. We want to use this feedback to ensure that each life-history interview was a
positive experience for the respondent.
We will provide feedback to your team leader when the verification forms are received, logged and there
is information to relay. Although it’s unclear the response rate we’ll get, the goal is to receive verification
feedback from 10% of interviews.
The evaluation reports generated and verification feedback received will be used to assist in the
monitoring of these critical pieces of the data collection process -- and will be updated and sent to
supervisory staff weekly.

## COMPLETING YOUR TIME RECORDS IN TENROX OR ET

You must submit time according to the Tenrox or ET schedule. (Refer to the Tenrox manual for
complete instructions.) It is important to keep track of your time on a daily basis. At the end of each day,
total the time spent, select the appropriate work type(s) that correspond to the work you performed,
and enter this on your Tenrox timesheet.

## TENROX WORK TYPE DEFINITIONS

The Tenrox cost-reporting module is designed to provide rapid and up-to date effort and cost
information to inform decisions about data collection protocols. Because of this, it is important to
complete the cost module every day.
The Survey Research Center (SRC) has defined a standard set of study phase codes for use on all data
collection projects as part of our efforts to track data collection costs. Each study phase code represents
a specific activity (or set of activities) performed by data collection staff; so, it's important that you
use the codes carefully and correctly. Every data collection effort is slightly different, so you may find
that certain projects define the codes uniquely.

### Main Data Collection


### Main Data Collection-Administration

Simply defined, this study phase code includes all time you spend on the project that does not directly
involve data collection. This may include time spent in meetings with your supervisor, participating in
conference calls, completing your weekly report, entering your time in Tenrox, packing and mailing
materials back to the Ann Arbor office, Sending and Receiving in SurveyTrak, checking and responding
to email, sending pre-contact letters, requesting persuasion letters, transferring sample, and doing post





**Keywords:** Life-history interviews, data collection, Tenrox, ET (time tracking software), Survey Research Center (SRC), time records, verification feedback, study phase codes
<!-- Page 43 -->


office errands and/or office supply errands (but not the travel to and from the post office or office )

### Main Data Collection-Computer Problems

Includes time spent working with Helpdesk on specific software/hardware computer problems.

### Main Data Collection-Production

Production includes only time spent conducting the actual interview with a respondent,
completing interviewer observations, calling for appointments and entering call records into the
computer.

### Main Data Collection-Locating

This work type is to be used only by an authorized tracker assigned to assist ACL with
specialized locating efforts.

## PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

Summary of Interviewer Tasks
1. Be prepared. Review the supplies you have received and know the study concepts and
procedures.
2. Review Respondent Profiles and sample lines in SurveyTrak.
4.. Plan your approach for working your sample in order to maximize effort and minimize cost.
5. Prepare your introduction based on the respondents you will be contacting.
6. Practice aversion and conversion approaches by role-playing with family members and friends and
brainstorming with colleagues on conference calls. Remember—forewarned is forearmed! The most
often heard resistance/refusal phrases are addressed in the study guide and you can know persuasive,
knowledgeable responses!
7. Make complete, detailed Call Notes for documentation this wave and to be used in the future.
8. Continue to use this study guide as a reference throughout data collection. Annotate it during
training and the course of data collection.
9. Monitor your sample and review your work.
Enjoy this study and your success on it!
